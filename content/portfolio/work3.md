This project was completed during the MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects. The aim of the project was to model a Penrose (impossible) staircase inspired by M.C Escher's Assending and Decending artwork and have a simple bouncing ball interacting with it.

The approach I took involved modelling a castle that turned out to be a hybrid of a typical Disney castle and Escher's. Both the model and the animation were completed in Maya with the aid of some simple MEL scripting.  The scene was lit and shaded using Maya and rendered in Arnold.

The overall aesthetic of the project was inspired by post-modern art. 
In particular, *Oneothrix Point Never* music videos which depict a variety of static everyday objects posed with surreal and often confusing textures.
