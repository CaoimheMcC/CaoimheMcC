This rig was created for a group project during the MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects. Having little to no experience rigging prior to this creature, I began to teach myself the fundamentals and necessary requirements to complete a game-ready rig. <!--more--> Rigging seemed like a great oppertunity to use my problem solving skills and tackle the project like a puzzle.  

This rig was used to create the sole on-screen character in a low-poly horror game created in Unreal Engine 4. 
After the completion of the project and wanting to widen my knowledge of rigging, I wrote a personal enquiry paper on rigging as well as a comparision study of Maya and Houdini's rigging capabilities, focusing on the auto-rig tools available in each.
