This garden generator Houdini Digital Asset was created during the course of my Masters degree at Bournemouth University. It was my first introduction to Houdini, and was created in line with the assignment brief. <!--more--> The HDA was required to be an artist friendly procedural asset that can quickly configure a garden. The brief outlined the assets requirment to have a flexible and intuitive user interface and to use five simple geometry models as vegetation that can eaisly be switched out for higher poly versions. 

Part of the main criteria of this assignment was "fun". With this in mind, the focus turned to ensuring this tool be simple to use and highly artist friendly. This tool allows for painting on vegetation, drawing fences and paths directly onto the ground geometry along with the ability to use greyscale maps to determine path position. As a result this project was rewarded a high distinction.
