As part of a Simulation and Rendering assignment during the course of my Master's degree, this lemon was completed using RenderMan and it's associated API. It was modeled directly in RIB and shaded using OSL (Open Shading Language). <!--more-->

The shaders created allowed for the colouring and displacement of the lemon's pore-like pits. 
Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm), a continuous-time Gaussian process, was used to create the self-similar pitting. This was implemented in a OSL file.

The completion of this project gave me a great understanding of techniques and systems used in modern rendering systems. 

The image below shows primitive sphere models with fBm applied.     <br>
