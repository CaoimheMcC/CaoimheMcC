Hello! After graduating my Bachelors degree in Mathematics with a first class honors, I began to teach myself the basics of Software Engineering to get some more industry ready skills. I have worked in hospitality for years and have gained some invaluable people and communication skills because of this. Throughout this time I discovered my love for VFX and creating visually catching content, so I chose to study the MSc in Computer Animation and Visual Effects at the industry renowned Bournemouth University. The course enabled me to use my mathematical and problem solving skills while also expressing my creative side.

My main areas of interest are generating effects and simulations in Houdini and creating procedural tools for artists to use. I also enjoy rigging and hope to soon complete an entirely procedural rig using the Maya python API. 

#### Education

* **MSc Computer Animation + Visual Effects**, Bournemouth University  
   Graduated with Distinction
