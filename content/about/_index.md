Hello! After graduating my Bachelors degree in Mathematics with a first class honors, I began teaching myself the basics of Software Engineering to get some more industry ready skills. I have worked in hospitality for years mainly as a barista and gained some invaluable people and communication skills. Throughout this time I discovered my love for VFX and creating visually catching content and so I chose to study the MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects at the industry renowned Bournemouth University. With the resources available the subjects taught enabled me to use my mathematical and problem solving skills while also expressing my creative side. I have always loved puzzles and each project I've worked on so far has challenged my abilities and have been incredibly rewarding!
I am continuing to build my skills and am eager to enter the industry. 

#### Education
